- [Khan Academy's unit on Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/xa88397b6:probability)

### Permutation Testing Visualization

This article and visualization intuitively decribes permutation testing. It's very helpful for thinking about how permutation testing works and why it is useful.
