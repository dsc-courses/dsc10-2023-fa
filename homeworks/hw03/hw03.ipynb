    "- First, you pick five **different** numbers, one at a time, from 1 to 34, representing that according to [USNews](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-san-diego-1317#:~:text=based%20academic%20calendar.-,University%20of%20California%2C%20San%20Diego's%20ranking%20in%20the%202022%2D2023,Jolla%20community%20of%20San%20Diego.), UCSD is ranked 34 in the nation for best universities to attend for 2022-2023.\n",
    "- Then, you separately pick a number from 1 to 10. This is because UCSD's Data Science program is rank 10th in [USNews's](https://ucsdtritons.com/news/2020/9/8/general-triton-tuesday-uc-san-diego-home-to-award-winning-faculty.aspx) Best Undergraduate Data Science Programs list. Let's say you select 3.\n",
    "- The six numbers you have selected, or  **your numbers**, can be represented all together as (7, 12, 24, 15, 13, 3). This is a _sequence_ of six numbers ‚Äì **order matters**!\n",
    "\n",
    "The **winning numbers** are chosen by King Triton drawing five balls, one at a time, **without replacement**, from a pot of white balls numbered 1 to 34. Then, he draws a gold ball, the Tritonball, from a pot of gold balls numbered 1 to 10. Both pots are completely separate, hence the different ball colors. For example, maybe the winning numbers are (15, 9, 24, 23, 1, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "We‚Äôll assume for this problem that in order to win the grand prize (free housing), all six of your numbers need to match the winning numbers and be in the **exact same positions**. In other words, your entire sequence of numbers must be exactly the same as the sequence of winning numbers. However, if some numbers in your sequence match up with the corresponding number in the winning sequence, you will still win some Triton Cash. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose again that you select (7, 12, 24, 15, 13, 3) and the winning numbers are (15, 9, 24, 23, 1, 3). In this case, two of your numbers are considered to match two of the winning numbers. \n",

    "- Winning numbers: (15, 9, **24**, 23, 1, **3**)\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't win free housing, but you will win some Triton Cash. Note that although both sequences include the number 15 within the first five numbers (representing a white ball), since they are in different positions, that's not considered a match.\n"
