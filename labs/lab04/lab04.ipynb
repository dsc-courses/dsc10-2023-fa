    "In the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, each player takes on the role of a certain character.\n",

    "To perform an action, a player rolls a 20-sided die, adds a \"modifier\" number to the roll, and compares the total to a threshold for success.  The value of the modifier depends on the player's character's competence in performing the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this question, we'll work with the following concrete example. Suppose Alice's character, a barbarian warrior named Roga, is trying to knock down a heavy door.  Alice rolls a 20-sided die, adds a modifier of 11 to the result (because her character is good at knocking down doors), and succeeds in knocking down the door if the total is at least 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1.1.** Write code that simulates this procedure.  Compute three values: \n",
    "- the result of Alice's 20-sided die roll (`roll_result`), \n",
    "- the result of her roll plus Roga's modifier of 11 (`modified_result`), and \n",
    "- a Boolean value indicating whether the action succeeded (`action_succeeded`).  \n",

She would separate herself from the practitioner with a board, so they couldn't see her, and she'd ask them to place both hands through an opening in the board. Emily would flip a coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would place her hands above the practitioner's left hand or the practitioner's right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to detect Emily's HEF and specify whether Emily was hovering above their left hand or their right hand. Overall, in 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n",
