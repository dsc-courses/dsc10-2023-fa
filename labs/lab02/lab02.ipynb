    "Welcome to Lab 2! This week, you'll get practice some DataFrame methods (especially `groupby`), create data visualizations, and learn how to define your very own functions in Python. Creating functions may be new to you, but don't worry, this assignment will guide you through that process! You should complete this entire lab so that all tests pass and submit it to Gradescope by 11:59PM on the due date.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topics on this lab are covered in [BPD 6](https://notes.dsc10.com/01-getting_started/functions-defining.html), [11](https://notes.dsc10.com/02-data_sets/groupby.html), [12](https://notes.dsc10.com/02-data_sets/apply.html) in the `babypandas` notes and [Chapter 7](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/07/Visualization.html) in the CIT textbook.\n",

But if you do know what they are and are wondering why it's not OK to use them, it is because loops in Python are slow, and looping over arrays and DataFrames should usually be avoided.\n",

    "## 3. Defining Functions ‚ûó\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a very simple function that converts a proportion to a percentage by multiplying it by 100.  For example, the value of `to_percentage(0.5)` should be the number 50.  (No percent sign.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A function definition has a few parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `def`\n",
    "It always starts with `def` (short for **def**ine):\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Name\n",
    "Next comes the name of the function.  Let's call our function `to_percentage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def to_percentage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Signature\n",
    "Next comes something called the *signature* of the function.  This tells Python how many *arguments* your function should have, and what names you'll use to refer to those arguments in the function's code.  `to_percentage` should take one argument, and we'll call that argument `proportion` since it should be a proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def to_percentage(proportion)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We put a colon after the signature to tell Python it's over.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Documentation\n",
    "Functions can do complicated things, so **you should write an explanation of what your function does**.  For small functions, this is less important, but it's a good habit to learn from the start.  Conventionally, Python functions are documented by writing a triple-quoted string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Body\n",
    "Now we start writing code that runs when the function is called.  This is called the *body* of the function.  We can write anything we could write anywhere else.  First let's give a name to the number we multiply a proportion by to get a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "    factor = 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `return`\n",
    "The special instruction `return` in a function's body tells Python to make the value of the function call equal to whatever comes right after `return`. The return statement also *ends the function* and once it's called *no lines in the body after it are run*. Since we want the value of `to_percentage(0.5)` to be the proportion 0.5 times the factor 100, we write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "    factor = 100\n",
    "    return proportion * factor\n",
