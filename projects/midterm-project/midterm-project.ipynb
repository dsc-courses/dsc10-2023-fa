    "## Due Tuesday, May 9th at 11:59PM\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Midterm Project! Projects in DSC 10 are similar in format to homeworks, but are different in a few key ways. First, a project is comprehensive, meaning that it draws upon everything we've learned this quarter so far. Second, since problems can vary quite a bit in difficulty, some problems will be worth more points than others. Finally, in a project, the problems are more open-ended; they will usually ask for some result, but won't tell you what method should be used to get it. There might be several equally-valid approaches, and several steps might be necessary. This is closer to how data science is done in \"real life\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you **start early** on the project! It will take the place of a homework in the week that it is due, but you should also expect it to take longer than a homework. You are especially encouraged to **find a partner** to work through the project with. If you work in a pair, you must follow the [Project Partner Guidelines](https://dsc10.com/project-partners/) on the course website. In particular, you must work together at the same time, and you are not allowed to split up the problems and each work on certain problems. If working in a pair, you should submit one notebook to Gradescope for the both of you. Your partner doesn't have to be in the same lecture section as you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** The `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch basic mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). Directly sharing answers between groups is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unless explicitly directed to, do not use for-loops or import any packages.** Loops in Python are slow, and looping over arrays and DataFrames should usually be avoided in favor of commands that are meant specifically for these objects. Please do not import any additional packages ‚Äì you don't need them, and our autograder may not be able to run your code if you do.\n",
