    "- The Midterm Project is due on **Tuesday, 5/9 at 11:59PM**.\n",
    "    - You can work with a partner from any lecture section, but if you do, you must follow these [project partner guidelines](https://dsc10.com/project-partners/). In particular, you must both contribute to all parts of the project and not split up the problems.\n",
    "    - We will hold a mixer **today from 1:30 to 2:15PM in the Center Hall courtyard** to help you find a partner if you don't have one. See [this Ed post](https://edstem.org/us/courses/38383/discussion/3020444) for questions.\n",

    "- Almost every `for`-loop in DSC 10 will use the **accumulator pattern**.\n",
    "    - This means we initialize a variable, and repeatedly add on to it within a loop.\n",
    "    - The variable could be an integer, an array, or even a string (as in Homework 3, Question 4: Triton Tweets).\n",
    "    - Analogy: Start with a blank piece of paper and write something on it each time you run an experiment.\n",
    "    \n",
